# Tutorial

## Get started with Ecotone

The best way to get started with `Ecotone` is to use it to build something realistic.  
We will build a small back-end for shopping system during this tutorial. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any application using `Ecotone`. 

In doing so, you'll learn the architectural concepts behind the software and start to learn its capabilities.  You will learn how to build types of applications that may have seemed impossible or really, really hard to make prior to learning _Ecotone_.

### Lessons

The tutorial is divided into several lessons:

* [Lesson 1](lesson-1-messaging-concepts.md), we will learn **the fundamentals** of _Ecotone_: Endpoints, Messages, Channels, Gateways and using Command Query Responsibility Segregation \(CQRS\) on top of that
* [Lesson 2](lesson-2-tactical-ddd.md),  we will learn using **Tactical** [**Domain Driven Design \(DDD\)**](../modelling/modelling-1.md): Aggregates, Repositories and also Event Handlers
* [Lesson 3](lesson-3-converters.md), we will learn **how to use Converters**
* [Lesson 4](lesson-4-method-invocation-and-metadata.md), we will learn about **Metadata and Method Invocation**
* [Lesson 5](lesson-5-cross-cutting-concerns.md), we will learn about **Interceptors**, to handle cross cutting concerns
* [Lesson 6](lesson-6-scheduling-and-asynchronous.md), we we will learn about **Scheduling And Asynchronous** Endpoints

You don’t have to complete all of the lessons at once to get the value out of this tutorial.   
You may start benefit from the tutorial even if it’s one or two lessons.
