## About

[_Ecotone Framework_](https://github.com/ecotoneframework/ecotone) __isolates business logic from complex integration responsibilities.  
`Ecotone` achieve that by implementing well known [Enterprise Integration Patterns](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) \(EIP\) and enabling message driven architecture in PHP. On top of that follow an architectural pattern which is based on the principles of Domain-Driven Design \(DDD\) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation \(CQRS\).  


One of the central tenets of the _`Ecotone`_ is the idea that you should not be forced to introduce framework-specific classes and interfaces into your business/domain model. However, in some places the `Ecotone` does give you the option to introduce _Ecotone-specific dependencies_ as it might be just plain easier to read or code some specific piece of functionality in such a way. The _Ecotone_ \(almost\) always offers you the choice though.
