## About

[_Ecotone Framework_](https://github.com/ecotoneframework/ecotone) _is `Service Bus`_ Implementation for PHP. __  
`Ecotone` enables true  message driven architecture in PHP, using [_Enterprise Integration Patterns_](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) \(`EIP`\). On top of that follow an architectural patterns which are based on the principles of _Domain-Driven Design_ \(`DDD`\), _Command Query Responsibility Segregation_ \(`CQRS`\) and _Event Sourcing_ \(`ES`\).

{% hint style="success" %}
Ecotone provides PHP with Command Bus, Query Bus, Event Bus, Interceptors, Aggregates, Sagas, Event Sourcing built on solutions that are message driven at the fundamental levels, and using integration with well known and stable solutions like [Enqueue](https://php-enqueue.github.io/) for asynchronous communication and [Prooph](http://getprooph.org) for Event Store.
{% endhint %}

  
With all of this in mind, one of the central tenets of the _`Ecotone`_ is the idea that you should not be forced to introduce framework-specific classes and interfaces into your business/domain model.   
To keep your _business code clean from technical problems and integrations_.
